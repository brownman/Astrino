<h1> The Defense of Astrino </h1>

<p>
  The Defense of Astrino is a Browser-based game in early development.
</p>

<p>
  It's meant to be run with a small number of players.  When it's more
  complete, run a server and invite your friends!
</p>

<p>
  Defense of Astrino is based on Rob Balder and Jamie Noguchi's free
  online comic
  <a href="http://www.erfworld.com">ErfWorld</a>, and much of the
  in-game artwork is taken from there.  So are in-game areas,
  characters and themes.  Knowledge of ErfWorld isn't necessary to
  play Astrino, but may make it more enjoyable or explain in-game
  oddities (e.g. "why do they talk about croaking?  Why do they say
  Twoll and Dwagon?").
</p>

<h2> Who Can Play? </h2>

<p>
  Currently, anybody with Flash 8 or higher installed in their browser
  of choice.  That's almost everybody, these days, and should include
  FireFox, Internet Explorer, and Chrome.  We'll test as we can.
  I use FireFox, so it has better support than other browsers.
</p>

<h2> Can I Run My Own Copy? </h2>

<p>
  Sure.  The code is freely available.  You can find it
  <a href="http://github.com/noahgibbs/astrino">at its page on
  GitHub</a>.  You'll need Ruby on Rails to be working on your
  machine, and you'll need to
  install <a href="http://noahgibbs.github.com/RailsGame">RailsGame</a>.
  Right now, RailsGame is not compatible with a Windows server, so
  neither is Defense of Astrino.  If you want to run it on Windows, let
  me know and we can get it debugged together.
</p>

<h2> Running Defense of Astrino </h2>

<p>
  To run Astrino on a single server, you'll need to run
  "./run_server.sh" from its root directory where you downloaded it.
  That will run Juggernaut, the Rails server and the game server for
  you.  Then, connect to that machine on port 4444 with your browser.
