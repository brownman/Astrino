The Defense of Astrino, a RailsGame based on ErfWorld

Early stages.

=== Requirements ===

RailsGame, including all dependencies.  Astrino also works much better
if you have a public-facing IP address with a matching name.  Otherwise,
it's hard for people to point their web browsers at your server.

=== Installation ===

Copy pv.sh to private_variables.sh.  Then, edit private_variables.sh
to match your desired server settings.
